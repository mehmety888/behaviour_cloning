# Behavioral Cloning Project

Overview
---
This repository contains the files for the Behavioral Cloning Project in Self Driving Car Nanodegree of Udacity.

In this project I used convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. I've trained, validated and tested a model using Keras. The model outputs a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

The following resources can be found in this github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py
